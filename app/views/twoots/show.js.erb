/*

This is brittle as all get-out: forget the alert ""s and you're broken.

Suppose you get the wrong string of " or ' and the interpolated text can close
the JavaScript " and your'e broken.  You're going to have to try very hard to
_not_ get broken.

Obviously you can use a lot of JavaScript here, more than just an alert() you
could use jQuery to append the content into the DOM.

You should always use the j() method or escape_javascript() method to escape
data that is sent into the view where escaping might be an issue.  Imagine that
@twoot.body has a " in it.  When that's interpolated you might induce a
JavaScript syntax error!

alert("<%= Rails.version -%> saw <%= @twoot.body -%>");
$("body").append("<%= j(@twoot.body) -%>");
